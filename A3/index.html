          <h3> Visualization 1</h3>
          <div id="view3"></div>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>From the data, we can see that there are a few platforms that performed extremely well in a certain genre. For example, the Wii excelled in Sport games sales, the PS3 dominated the Action Game Sales and the Xbox 360 selling the most Shooter games. It would be interesting to see how this data matches with how many platforms were sold to see the number of games per one console relationship
          </p>

      <div class="part1subContainer">
          <h3> Visualization 2</h3>
          <div id="view4"></div>
          <div id="view5"></div>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>From the data, an interesting insights from the relationship between global sales and platforms over time is that the GBA and the PS2 experience an almost identical path with spikes and drops happening at the same time. Additonally, it is interesting to see the relationship between the change in platform global sales and the genre global sales. For example, both action and sport games reached their peak at the same time the Wii reached its peak in global sales. Another example of this relationship is the puzzle genre experiencing a spike at the same time the GB spikes up.</p>

          <div id="view9"></div>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>An interesting insight that arises from the data are platform regional preferences. In North America, the most successful platform was the Xbox360, in Europe the most successful platform was the PS3, and in JP the most successful platform was the DS. Interestingly, across all 3 regions, the PS2 remained consistently being one of the dominant platforms, being the second most successful platform in all 3 regions </p>

          <h3> Visualization 4</h3>
          <div id="view10"></div>
          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p>From this visualization, I wanted to see the JP region's preferences in genre over time. Interesting insights from this visualization is the sudden dominance and crash of platforming games in the 1980s. Additionally, Role-Playing games have been JP region's most dominant genre the longest, being the highest selling genre from 1995 to 2015 </p>
